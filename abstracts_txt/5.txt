Integrative modeling enables structure determination of macromolecular complexes by combining data from multiple experimental sources such as X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy or cross-linking mass spectrometry. It is particularly useful for complexes not amenable to high-resolution electron microscopy-complexes that are flexible, heterogeneous or imaged in cells with cryo-electron tomography. We have recently developed an integrative modeling protocol that allowed us to model multi-megadalton complexes as large as the nuclear pore complex. Here, we describe the Assembline software package, which combines multiple programs and libraries with our own algorithms in a streamlined modeling pipeline. Assembline builds ensembles of models satisfying data from atomic structures or homology models, electron microscopy maps and other experimental data, and provides tools for their analysis. Compared with other methods, Assembline enables efficient sampling of conformational space through a multistep procedure, provides new modeling restraints and includes a unique configuration system for setting up the modeling project. Our protocol achieves exhaustive sampling in less than 100-1,000 CPU-hours even for complexes in the megadalton range. For larger complexes, resources available in institutional or public computer clusters are needed and sufficient to run the protocol. We also provide step-by-step instructions for preparing the input, running the core modeling steps and assessing modeling performance at any stage.
